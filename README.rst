MyNCList
========

Overview
--------
MyNCList is an implementation of the NCList data structure within a MySQL
database. The included python script reads data stored in a .BED file,
organizes it into the NCList structure and uploads the data to MySQL, where
stored procedures allow for in-place insertions and deletions, along with
efficient interval-based querying.

Dependencies
------------
MyNCList requires Python2.7, `MySQL-python`, and a MySQL database in 
which to store the NCList structure. Installation should automatically
install `MySQL-python` and can install MySQL locally if specified.

If `setuptools` is not installed, you may download it from pypi:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

Installation
------------
It is recommended that users install from the contents of dist/.

Automated Linux install:

```
	cd dist/  
	sudo MyNCList-install.sh
```
or

```
	cd dist/
	sudo MyNCList-install.sh --mysql
```

If access to MySQL is not available, option 2b will install mysql onto your
local linux machine, and create a database called `nclist` to be used by
MyNCList. Users should update their configuration files to reflect this 
information.

Users with access to MySQL should create this database manually and specify
the information in the configuration file. MyNCList.py will not attempt to 
create, delete, or modify any database besides those specified in
configuration files.

For manual Linux installation: 

1. `cd dist/`  
2. `tar -zxvf MyNCList-1.0.tar.gz`  
3. `cd MyNCList-1.0`  
4. `sudo python setup.py install`  

For manual Windows installation: 

1. `cd dist/`  
2. Unzip MyNCList-1.0.zip  
3. `cd MyNCList-1.0`  
4. `python setup.py install`

Configuration Files
-------------------
Configuration options for MyNCList should be specified in a config file, with
a space separating the configuration parameter and its value. A sample config
file is included with the distributable. MySQL tables will be created following
the convention `DBNAME`.`LABEL_TABLENAME` (e.g. `nclist`.`sample_masterkey`)
and will overwrite existing tables if necessary, so unique labels are strongly
encouraged.

Database Parameters:

```
	DBHOST		MySQL hostname
	DBUSER		MySQL user
	DBPASS		MySQL password
	DBNAME		MySQL database
```

Required Parameters:

```
	BEDFILE		Location of source .BED file
	OFFSET 		Location chromosome base position offsets file
	WORKDIR		Working directory for intermediate files
	LABEL		Label for this set of annotations
```

Optional Parameters:

```
	MEMBERSHIP	Nest interval within the [first,last] valid parent
	REPORTS		Output additional intermediate files? [yes,no]
	CONCAT_DUPS	Concatenate annotations for duplicate intervals? [yes,no]
```
